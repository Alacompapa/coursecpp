    Commands for step 1
g++-8 -c main.cc                    (to create an object file)
cd data                             (or to the directory where your data.h and functions are located)
g++-8 -c display.cc read.cc         (to compile those files)
ar rvs libdata.a display.o read.o   (to create library)
mv libdata.a ..                     (move the library to where main.o is located)
cd ..
g++-8 main.o libdata.a              (to link object file to library)
