Exercise 33.

Basic exercise

Purpose: acquire some familiarization with the pointer concept.

Describe in your own words (use Dutch if you're Dutch).

Be concise:
just mention the, in your opinion, essential difference(s).

- what differences exist between pointer variables and arrays;

- what differences exist between pointer variables and reference variables;

- how element [3][2] is reached (submit a clear drawing)
Your drawing should clearly show how the memory is accessed by array and pointer
It should also show what is meant by "pointer arithmetic"

        a: for the variable `int array[20][30]'
        b: for the variable `int *pointer[20]'.
