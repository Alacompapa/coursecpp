Likewise we distinguish three categories of assignment operators:: the copy-assignment operator, the move assignment operator, and all other assignment operators (also considered a single category in this exercise).

Fill out the entries in the following table: the row labels specify what you have defined. Consider each row by itself: the row element specifies the only member that you defined. Then, for each row

put a - in the cells where the column element is NOT provided by the compiler (e.g., when you define the default constructor then the compiler doesn't provide the default constructor, and so there's a - in that row/column element);
put CC in the cells where the compiler uses the copy constructor instead of the column element;
put MC in the cells where the compiler uses the move constructor instead of the column element;
put C= in the cells where the compiler uses the copy assignment instead of the column element;
put M= in the cells where the compiler uses the move assignment instead of the column element;
Put a + in all other cases (meaning: the compiler provides a default implementation of the column element)
Hint: not all of the above indicators are used.
