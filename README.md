# Course programming C++

- Should we stop writing: using namespace std?
- Do we need a styleguide?
  - Maybe for naming the exercises or something
  - Let's always use the .cc extension
  - So I already found out the way I'm adding comments now is wrong
  - We should set a hard limit at linelength 80 (so we never have any printer issues)
- Which build tools are we going to use? I thought `icmake` looked nicest
  icmstart icmbuild - these two are important i think.
- I'm not a master git user so I don't know how to add you so you can also accept pull requests
