Learn to store an (apriori unknown) number of data elements in a class, by using pointers to enlarge the required memory at the point it's necessary.

Create a program that determines the frequencies of when characters occur. It should be able to count characters in any filetype (pdf, txt, csv, etc.)

Your program should use a class CharCount doing all the hard work. It offers a member count, expecting a std::istream (at this point it can only be std::cin) and returning the number of characters in the file (note that if you want to process a file you should use redirection, using a command like program < file).

class Charcount
{

    struct CharInfo
    {
        Char *ptr; <- this will be a pointer to a list of pointers?
        size_t nCharObj;
    }

    private:

    size_t count(std::istream stream)
    {
        return number_of_characters
    }

    CharInfo& info()
    {

    }

Internally it should define a struct CharInfo having a field ptr pointing to struct Char objects and a field nCharObj storing how many Char objects were stored. ^^^^


struct Char
{
    char ch;
    size_t count;
}
